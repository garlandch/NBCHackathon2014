FastAndOculus7 uses Oculus Rift to immerse users into a virtual reality world, where they can view movie trailers in an entirely new and revolutionary manner. When the user enters the program, they are absorbed into a world of videos. The majority of the media that we used are videos because it is the most direct way to visualize concepts and advertise movies. Users can walk around the space to view video contents. In additional, the idea of this project is to increase fans interactions not only with the movie, but also with other fans. Therefore, besides the fascinating environment to watch videos, there are also tweets about the movie or certain characters floating around in the space. This allows users to constantly view other peopleâ€™s review while exploring the scenes in the movie.
